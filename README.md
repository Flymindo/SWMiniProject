# SWMiniProject

The app allows users to determine total amount of calories in recipes. The app automatically calculates total amount of calories of recipes 
as a user adds foods to recipies by Scanning barcode of the food. 

This repository is dedicated to the EC463 software mini-project created by Do Hun Ji and Stanley Zhang. Our app was designed to be able to:

Authenticate users via Gmail

- Scan barcodes of food items, calculate a total amount of calories you are adding based on a serving size, and display it.

- Allow users to store/update/delete recipes of these food items

- Automatically calculate a total amount of calories per recipe and display it on the screen.

# Built With:

- REACT NATIVE
